# These global owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence.
# They will be requested for review when someone opens a pull request.

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. When someone opens a pull request that only
# modifies <ext> files, only @<ext>-owner and not the global
# owner(s) will be requested for a review.
# *.<ext>   @<owner>

# You can also use email addresses if you prefer. They'll be
# used to look up users just like we do for commit author
# emails.
# *.<ext>   docs@example.com

# Teams can be specified as code owners as well.
# Teams must have explicit write access to the repository.
# *.<ext>   @org/team-name

# In this example, @<owner> owns any files in the build/logs
# directory at the root of the repository and any of its
# subdirectories.
# /build/logs/ @<owner>

# The `docs/*` pattern will match files like
# `docs/getting-started.md` but not further nested files like
# `docs/build-app/troubleshooting.md`.
# docs/*  docs@example.com

# In this example, @octocat owns any file in an apps directory
# anywhere in your repository.
# apps/ @octocat

# In this example, any change inside the `/scripts` directory
# will require approval from @doctocat or @octocat.
# /scripts/ @doctocat @octocat

# In this example, @octocat owns any file in the `/apps`
# directory in the root of your repository except for the `/apps/github`
# subdirectory, as its owners are left empty.
# /apps/ @octocat
# /apps/github
